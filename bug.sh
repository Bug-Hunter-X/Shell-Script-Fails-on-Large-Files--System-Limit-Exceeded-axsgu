# This script attempts to process a large file, but it can fail due to exceeding system limits.

# Incorrect way (may fail for large files):
# while IFS= read -r line; do
#   # Process each line
#   echo "Processing: $line"
# done < "large_file.txt"

# Correct way (processes in chunks to avoid exceeding limits):
while IFS= read -r -d $'\0' chunk; do
  # Process the chunk of lines
  echo "Processing chunk:"
  echo "$chunk"
done < <(find large_file.txt -print0)

# Add error handling
