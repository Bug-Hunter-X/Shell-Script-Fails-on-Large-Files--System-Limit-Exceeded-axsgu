# This script processes a large file in chunks to avoid exceeding system limits.

# Correct way (processes in chunks to avoid exceeding limits):
while IFS= read -r -d $'\0' chunk; do
  # Process the chunk of lines
  echo "Processing chunk:"
  echo "$chunk"
done < <(find large_file.txt -print0)

# Add error handling

if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "Error processing the file."
  exit 1
